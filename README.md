# Melod

## Description

Melod is a simple iOS app built using SwiftUI, with a focus on integrating CoreML and CreateML for a unique music playlist experience. Inspired by Spotify, Melod allows users to select songs from a JSON-based playlist. The app then suggests additional songs to add, utilizing a custom-built song recommendation model.

## Installation

Prerequisites: Requires iOS 17 on an iPhone or an iOS simulator.

Setup:
1. Clone the repository in Xcode.
2. Build and run the application on a device or simulator running iOS 17.
## Usage

Melod is designed for iPhones, offering functionalities similar to Spotify. Users can interact with a playlist, which includes song titles and artists (note: songs do not play audio). Key features include:

* Viewing an initially suggested playlist based on popular choices from the model.
* Adding or deleting songs from the playlist.
* Receiving new song suggestions based on the current playlist.

## Project Status

This is a personal project, and I am not currently seeking contributions from others. However, I am open to feedback and suggestions.

## Future Plans

* Enhance the song suggestion model.
* Allow management of multiple playlists.
* Explore options for integrating song playback, possibly through APIs or internet searches.
